# WPMU reCaptcha
Add reCAPTCHA to your login pages. Works for WordPress Multisite. Please Network Activate this plugin. Only 1 api key is needed from Google as long as you do not domain map the wp-admin (backend) of your subsites.

Demo: http://psmutheme.com/wp-login.php

#### Important
After downloading from Github, you MUST rename the zip file from wpmu-recaptcha-master.zip to wpmu-recaptcha.zip to avoid any potential issues. I'll fix this later on so you wont need to rename it, but for now you should rename the file to wpmu-recaptcha.zip then upload it like usualy to your WordPress site to install and activate.

#### Compatibility
This plugin was create for WordPress multisite. Already tested on a MU network of 900+ subsites. At this time, this plugin does not work on standard WordPress sites. This is a MU plugin and is intended to be network activated.
